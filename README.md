# About myself
Starry Skies is a PC-port of [mobile mod (clickable link)](https://github.com/AndroidModLoader/GTA_StarrySkies). The original mod is adding way more stars and replaces the default R-shaped "picture"

# What's about support?
Supported game version is **GTA:SA 1.0 US __only__** and all versions of GTA:VC and GTA:III. ASI is universal for all games.
The mod has been tested in Modloader by [@TheArtemMaps](https://github.com/TheArtemMaps) and my team members (Rcrydan), also with SkyGFX and 2DFX Project.
